# Virginia Datacenter Map — Backlog

## Priority 1 (High Impact, Ready to Implement)

- **Live pricing API integration** — Replace static pricing JSON with EIA Form 861 live data fetch (quarterly updates)
- **Datacenter detail modal** — Click marker → show full facility details (operator, address, PUE, cooling tech, customer list if public)

## Priority 2 (Polish & Analytics)

- **Search / filter panel** — Find datacenters by operator, county, capacity range; highlight results on map
- **Historical price comparison** — Side-by-side utility region rate trends; export as CSV
- **Map basemap options** — Toggle between dark (current), light, satellite; persist in localStorage
- **Analytics tracking** — Pageviews, timeline scrubs, region clicks (via Plausible or similar privacy-focused tool)

## Priority 3 (Long-term)

- **Power consumption forecast model** — Integrate with Virginia load forecasts; project datacenter impact on grid demand
- **Renewable energy overlay** — Show solar/wind generation capacity by utility region (if data available)
- **Carbon intensity dashboard** — Emissions per kWh by region, impact on Virginia's grid mix
- **Public API** — Allow external tools to query datacenter + pricing data (JSON/GraphQL endpoint)
